#Tutorial: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
The tutorial is freely available at the SEAwise Github page of Task 6.x under link.
This tutorial showcases the R script mcda.R developed within the Seawise project under WP6 (see Garc√¨a et al. 2025) and applies a fictional dataset to demonstrate its use. The tutorial illustrates how MCDA can be integrated to evaluate the effectiveness of climate and management scenarios with respect to different stakeholder objectives (see link to tutorial).
