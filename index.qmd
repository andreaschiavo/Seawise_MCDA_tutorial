# Welcome

This is a tutorial to run an MCDA analysis on the output of the models from Seawise H2020 project case studies. The tutorial is divided into:

- [Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis concept](01_Theory.html), what is MCDA? what are possible applications? what has been done in Seawise?;
- [Seawise MCDA example](02_Theory_Seawise_example.qmd), briefly introducing the approach adopted in the Seawise project;
- [R-script](03_R-script.html), displaying a trial of the *mcda.R* script developed within the Seawise project;
- [Visualisation](04_Visualisation.html), showcasing the use of 3 built-in functions to plot MCDA results;
- [Options File](05_genOptionsFile.html), showing the preparation of the options file for the mcda.R script.

For additional information on the Seawise MCDA results consult the [SEAwise Report on the impacts of fisheries on stocks and landings under SEAwise EBFM - Garcia et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.29108039)
