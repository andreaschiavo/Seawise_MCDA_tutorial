# Tutorial: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)
This repository contains the code and data for the tutorial on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) developed within the [SEAwise project](https://seawiseproject.org/).

The [tutorial](https://andreaschiavo.github.io/Seawise_MCDA_tutorial/) illustrates the basic concepts of MCDA and demonstrates a simple *R* implementation developed within the WP6 of the SEAwise project. The analysis is based on the methodological approach presented in [Garcia et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.11583/DTU.29108039) where the MCDA is applied to evaluate the performance of multiple managment and climatic scenarios in the North Sea, Bay of Biscay and Central Mediterranean Sea case studies.

The repository includes:
- *mcda.R* script for performing MCDA using various methods;
- Dummy datasets to illustrate the application of MCDA;
- Options file generation script to customize the analysis.


More Seawise courses and tutorials are available on the [Seawise youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@seawiseproject5092) and the [Seawise GitHub](https://github.com/ices-tools-dev/SEAwise).
