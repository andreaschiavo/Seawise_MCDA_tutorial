# Criteria

In Seawise, we identified six macro-criteria, each corresponding to a management criteria: conserving stocks, conserving biodiversity, conserving habitats, mitigating climate change, sustaining communities, and ensuring economic viability.   


```{r, tabella-mcda, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  Macro_criterion = c(
    "Conserving stocks", "Conserving stocks",
    "Conserving biodiversity", "Conserving biodiversity",
    "Conserving habitats",
    "Mitigating climate change",
    "Sustaining communities", "Sustaining communities", "Sustaining communities",
    "Ensuring economic viability"
  ),
  Attribute = c(
    "Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB)",
    "Fishing mortality (F)",
    "Mean maximum length across trophic guilds (MML)",
    "Apex vertebrate predator biomass (AVPB)",
    "Relative benthic state (RBS)",
    "CO2 emissions per unit catch (CO2)",
    "Wage (WAGE)",
    "Employment (EMPL)",
    "Ratio between small and large scale fishery landing value (RSL)",
    "Gross value added (GVA)"
  ),
  Unit = c(
    "t", "yr–1", "cm", "t",
    "% area with RBS≥0.8",
    "tCO2 / kg", "€", "FTE", "--", "€"
  )
)

```

# Utility functions and reference points

For every indicator, we defined a utility function that maps its value to a range between zero — representing minimum satisfaction — and one — representing maximum satisfaction. Utility functions incorporated reference points whenever available; otherwise, the current value of the indicator served as a baseline.

# Alternatives/Scenarios

We defined a set of scenarios by combining different time horizons, climate projections, and fisheries management strategies:

- Time periods covering the years 2025 to 2060;

- Two climate projections, based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) from the IPCC;

- Case-study-specific fisheries management strategies, reflecting alternative regulatory approaches.
