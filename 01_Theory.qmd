# Introduction

In decision-making processes we are often confronted with multiple options or scenarios, each carrying different values with respect to the criteria or attributes that we consider important.
By comparing these criteria to reference thresholds, we can define our level of satisfaction with the different options.


However, decision-making is rarely straightforward: stakeholders usually have diverse interests, which generate conflicts and unresolved trade-offs among alternatives.

# MCDA

Multicriteria Decision Methods, or MCDM, provide a structured framework to address this complexity. They allow decision-makers to recognize possible trade-offs, to account for conflicting viewpoints, and to evaluate objectives that cannot be reduced to a single monetary dimension. This is particularly relevant in natural resource management, as shown in previous studies by Mardle and Pascoe (1999), Andalecio (2010), and Melià and colleagues (2017).

## MCDA in Fisheries Management

Fisheries management is a clear example. Here, the challenge is to reconcile objectives such as maximizing fishing yields and profits while minimizing ecological and social impacts. The transition towards an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach complicates this even further, because of the growing number of indicators used to describe the system. These indicators give us a holistic view of the ecosystem, but they also increase the number of conflicts and trade-offs that must be addressed.


# Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT)

Among the different MCDM approaches, Multi-Attribute Utility Theory, or MAUT (Keeney and Raiffa 1993), has gained particular relevance in resource and environmental management. MAUT is based on the idea that decision-makers aim to maximize their overall satisfaction, or expected utility, across multiple independent attributes — each representing a decision objective.

## MAUT key steps

The main steps of MAUT are the following:
 
 - identifying decision objectives and relevant indicators (attributes) to measure performance with respect to each of them;
 - developing utility functions that express the desirability, or satisfaction, associated with a given indicator value;
 - assigning weights to attributes reflecting their importance in the decision;
 - aggregating weighted utilities into a composite score representing the overall performance of a scenario;
 - comparing scenarios in terms of overall performance.

## Utility scores

The performance of each objective is translated into a utility score, and these partial utilities are then aggregated into a single measure of overall performance. This facilitates clear comparisons among management scenarios, promotes stakeholder engagement, and supports transparent, evidence-based policies.
